# Introduction
  This resource provisioning model is based on Qinglong Zeng's selection model.
  
  The address of the selected model is https://github.com/qz28/microbiosima
## rplot
The folder *rplot* contains the R scripts that plot the figures in the paper.

*ggplot2heatmap.R* is used to plot the patterns of alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, gamma-diversity, and *k*.

*ggplot2_lm.R* is used to plot the simple linear regression analysis of *k*s and parental contribution to hosts and environment.

*bacteric_contents.R* is used to plot the composition of microbiomes under different models.

*fitness_change.R* is used to plot the average log-fold relative changes in host fitness and microbial fitness at the start and end of the simulations with and without RPP.

## RPPmodel
Please refer to the Selection Model for the use of the RPP model.

*SelectiveIndividualK.java*, *SelectivePopulationK.java*, and *SelectiveMicrobiosimaK.java* were modified from *SelectiveIndividual.java*, *SelectivePopulation.java*, and *SelectiveMicrobiosima.java*.
